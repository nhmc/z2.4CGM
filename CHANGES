The following changes were made between the version first posted on
astro-ph and the final accepted version:

 - In section 2.2 we added a sentence saying that there is no evidence
   for unresolved, saturated components or partial covering.

 - We added HI, DI and many more metal transitions to Figure 2, to
   make the velocity structure and data quality more clear.

 - We made clear at the beginning of section 4 that the metallicity of
   the D component measured using Cloudy models does not use N(OI).

 - We slightly adjusted the column density upper limits for some high
   ions to be more conservative. These changes do not significantly
   affect our Cloudy models.

The main results and conclusions are unchanged between the two
versions.
